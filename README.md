# 💫 About Me:
SMK student majoring in Computer and Network Engineering (TKJ) with hands-on experience in web application security testing, endpoint analysis, and security misconfiguration. Comfortable with both manual testing and automation-assisted reconnaissance.

## What I Tested:
- Web application endpoints (admin, update, API, maintenance paths)
- Authentication and authorization flow
- Error handling and backend behavior
- Security misconfigurations in real-world-like environments

## What I Learned:
- How exposed maintenance endpoints can impact application integrity
- Why certain HTTP status codes indicate higher attack surface
- Difference between a bug and an information disclosure
- When to stop testing to avoid harming the system

## How I Think About Security
I focus on understanding application behavior before attempting any exploitation. I prioritize issues based on impact, accessibility, and attacker value, and avoid unnecessary brute-force or destructive testing.
